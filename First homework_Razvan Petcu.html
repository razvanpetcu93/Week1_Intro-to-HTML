        <h1>Rules for Autocomplete</h1>

        <h4><em>Posted on March 19, 2019</em></h4>
        
        <p>Autocompleting text with known values seems like an easy problem to solve, but <br>
             so so so many UIs get it worng. I see this frequently enough that, rather than <br>
            complain about them individually, I though I'd just write down the set of rules they <br>
            often break.
        </p>
        <P>There may be cases where some of these rules aren't the best thing to do, but there <br>
            should be a god reason for breaking one of these rules (for example, some of these <br>
            rules don't apply if a field must be filled with a value from a fixed set, like the list <br>
            of US states). Following thses rules should always result in at very least a sane<br>
            experience:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> Exact matches always come first. If the user types in an option exactly, other <br>
                options must always go below the one matching what they typed.</li>
            <li> Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first. If I type "FR" I want <br>
                "Fresno" not "San Francisco"</li> 
            <li> After prefix matches, it can fall back to substring matches. Starting with <br>
                substring matches would almost always be the wrong thing to do since users <br>
                start typing words at the beginning not somewhere in the middle.</li> 
            <li> If there are no substring matches, it can optionally fall back to subsequence <br>
                matcheing. This is only useful in some cases.</li>
            <li> If there are no subsequence/substring matches, it can optionally fall back to <br>
                approximate matches. This is rarely necessary to provide.</li>
            <li> Matches should be sorted alphabetically.</li>
            <li> When one option is the prefix of another, put the <em>shortest one first.</em></li>
            <li> The matching should probably be case insensitive unless there are two options <br>
                that differ only by case. In that case (pun intended), prefer the one that more <br>
                closely matches the user's input.</li>
            <li> The action to make use of the selection ( e.g. to search the term) must be a <br>
            different key than the action to accept the first suggestion <em>unless</em> you have to <br>
            do something first to start using autocomplete suggestions (e.g. hit the down <br>
            arrow). The user should never have to take extra steps to <em>not</em> use <br>
            autocomplete.</li>
        </ul>
